I received a review on my Pull Request (#tool:github.vscode-pull-request-github/activePullRequest) that I would like help addressing. Note that the review comments can also be wrong or misguided, so always verify if the comment is valid before making any changes.

<steps>
1. Analyze each unresolved review comment.
2. For each comment:
    - Verify if the comment is valid by checking the relevant code sections.
    - If valid, plan the necessary changes.
    - Implement the changes.
3. After making changes, run any necessary linters or tests to ensure code quality.
4. Summarize the changes made in response to the review comments.
</steps>
