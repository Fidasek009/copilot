I received a review comment on my Pull Request that I would like help addressing. Note that the PR comment can also be wrong or misguided, so always verify if the comment is valid before making any changes.

<steps>
1. Verify if the comment is valid by checking the relevant code sections.
2. If valid, plan the necessary changes.
3. Implement the changes.
4. Check for any linter or type errors inside the `workspace_diagnostics` environment details.
</steps>
